Simple Scrabble game that allows for 2-8 players. 

There is functionality for two different CPU player options. One that determines 
the best move by score (CPUS) and best move by length (CPUL). 

TODO:

While these two options are implemented: CPUL and CPUS still 
need to be incorporated into the game process.
